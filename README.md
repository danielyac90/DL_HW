Iris flower data set plot and classification 

## part 1
The first part is generating 4 3D scatter plots containing all the data.
## part 2
The second part is splitting the data by 'test_size_ratio' (configurable), each time mixing the testing and learning data.
## part 2.1
Using the training data with KNN (3 neighbors - configurable) to learn how to classify the data and plotting the success rates of the testing data classification.
## part 2.2
Using the training data with Logistic-regression (1000 max iterations - configurable) to learn how to classify the data and plotting the success rates of the testing data classification.


We can learn from this project that although it is difficult to quantify and classify the types of Iris on the 3D plots with our intuition, using simple learning methods we are able to do this quickly and efficiently.
